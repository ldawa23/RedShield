## Overview of the Project

Redshield is based on end-to-end penetration testing framework that displays entire security assessment lifecycle that includes reconnaissance, exploitation, remediation and reporting.

## Problem Statement

- Normal penetration testing takes around 3-4 weeks per engagement
- To generate report, Security related teams spend 40%
- Fixes in vulnerability lack clear and automated guidance
- No recheck proof of applied fixes

## Solution

This project gives a complete penetration testing workflow:
- **Scan**: Performs with multi tool like Nmap, Nuclei, Burp Suite
- **Exploit**: Safe Proof-of-concept validation with controls of authorization
- **Remediate**: Ansible focused auto fixes with rollback
- **Report**: Compilance ready with PDF/HTML reports

## Features (According to Plan)

- Automatic vulnerability Scanning
- Safe exploitation framework
- Ansible based fixes
- Real-time dashboard
- PDF/HTML report generation
- MITRE Attack mapping
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Docker containerization
